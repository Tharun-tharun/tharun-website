👋🏻 Welcome to my dream world! Hang around a bit to get to know me.

🚀 Researcher at Heart 💡 Creator at Work 🧠 inspired by ~ Maximus Decimus Meridius

I graduated with a Masters’s degree from [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) with my thesis work in computer vision.

I lead machine learning at EPICS. I just genuinely love pushing the boundaries of intelligent system to build things that actually move the needle. At EPICS, I’ve worked fine-tuning open source LLMs on exponential real world datasets also by integrating and deploying end-to-end TTS (Text-to-Speech) synthesis model for real-time voice driven interactions. I’ve designed scalable, cost effective pipelines that bring these models into production with precision. What gets me fired up is combining language models is where intelligent agents meet infrastructure because that’s where innovation turns into real world impact.

###### ongoing projects 🔭

Lately, I’ve been exploring the agentic AI systems using Reinforcement Learning with no human feedback. I’m now working towards open source projects that explore multi-agent collaboration with self-improving systems and dynamic tool usage like Model Context Protocol (MCP). I’m excited about the future of foundation models that don’t just respond but plan, adapt, work together and even surprise you. It's a small glimpse into what's possible when we empower intelligence with reasoning and autonomy.

- `50% coding/implementation like building and optimizing projects` 
- `25% keeping up with machine learning topics/reading papers/blogs`
- `25% spent going on walks, listening to music, reading books, podcasts, videos etc`

###### highlights

- 2025, cool things going around in Reinforcement Learning and Agent and its getting really fun to work. Will update soon on that!

- 2022-2023, I built a decent working projects through my master's thesis. Building something people want is the ultimate form of truth seeking and I believe everyone needs a time in their life where they practice that muscle you can find my work here [github](https://github.com/Tharun-tharun?tab=repositories)

- 2022, This was the year I went absolute demon mode doing loads of self-learning worked on multiple open projects and collaborating with other AI communities. This year was the year in which I 10xed my shipping speed :)

- 2015-2017, During this time, I spent some time doing competitive programming. I worked in some cool projects like recommedation system and neural style transfer.

My projects:
- [movie recommendation system](https://github.com/Tharun-tharun/Movie-Recommendation-System-with-Sentiment-Analysis) -- 30+ stars
- [neural style transfer](https://github.com/Tharun-tharun/Neural-Style-Transfer-Using-Pytorch) -- good enough stars, i guess :)

Let’s connect if you’re building in the agentic AI space. I’d love to collaborate and learn more from the community! [twitter]() 💬🤝 

Fun fact: I can type at close to 98 wpm
